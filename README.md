When facing the issue of your Xbox 360 controller not turning on, the first step is to perform some initial troubleshooting.

### Check the Power Source

Ensure that your controller has sufficient power. For wireless controllers, check if the batteries are charged or replace them with new ones. If you are using a wired controller, make sure it is properly connected to the console.
